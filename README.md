# React Native Challenge
Our React-native coding challenge is a simple "Crypto Tracker". Users should be able to add new cryptocurrencies, visualize the current price and the change in price in % for the last 24 hours, and also be able to remove a cryptocurrency from the "Crypto Tracker". 

```
Important: Please make sure you use ReactNative and state managements. 
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running. 
```

```
Minimum required mobile platforms is Android 10+ & IOS 13+
```

# Suggested design and assets:

You can find bellow a design mockup for the challenge. Feel free to use it or create your own:

For the assets we recommend the following react-native-vector-icons library, Choose one of available library from there.

# Main Features of the app

### 1) List of cryptocurrencies
Users should be able to visualize the list of cryptocurrencies they current have on the app

### 2) Current price and percentage change in the last 24h
Users should also be able to visualize: 
* Current price for the cryptocurrencies added
* Change in percentage in USD in the last 24h

### 3) API to get pricing
Feel free to use the pricing and percentage provider API of your preference. 
One of the simplest ones that doesn't require registration is Messari. 
It provides most of currency short codes such as ETH, BTC, ADA, XRP. 

Sample usage bellow:

### 5) Pricing and percentage change update
The Crypto Tracker should update the current values every 10 seconds. (10000ms)

```
 We suggest the use of expo, but feel free to rollout your own development
 We expect to solve this in between 8-15 hours, if you can do it in less than 10 hours thats perfect. Try limit yourself
 Use flexbox, core components should be enough but feel free to use any library, 
 Choose the language of your preference typescript or javascript.
